1967 Pontiac GTO: 
IN 1967, Pontiac had to revise their top model GTO according to a GM mandate that limited engine size to 400 in\xc2\xb3 and a single carburetor on everything but their sports cars. In response, Pontiac raised the displacement on the the 389 and the High Output (HO) 400 was born.

1969 Pontiac Trans-Am Ram Air IV: 
The L85 Ram Air V engine was the ultimate product of Pontiac\xe2\x80\x99s decade-long racing engine development program that began at the turn of the Sixties and was arguably the genesis of the musclecar era. Pontiac Special Projects Group developed three versions in displacements of 303, 366 and 400 cubic inches, the latter for street and drag race duty. All featured special high-flow tunnel-port heads, forged steel crank, four-bolt mains, 10.75:1 compression, 800cfm Holley 4-barrel, aluminum intake and a special high-rpm camshaft. The big 400 generated over 500 horses.

1969 Pontiac Trans-Am Ram Air III: 
In March of 1969, Pontiac quietly announced a new performance/trim option for its popular Firebird model, but it did not stay quiet for long. Dubbed the Trans Am (after the Trans American Racing Series), it quickly became a pony car icon and one of the best-known American muscle cars ever, ultimately dethroning the mighty GTO as Pontiac\xe2\x80\x99s most popular performance model.

1963 Pontiac Tempest Wagon 421 Super Duty: 
Without a doubt, the most unusual and exotic factory racecars to emerge from the Motor City in the early 1960s came in plain white wrappers – the legendary Super Duty Le Mans coupes and Tempest station wagons. Pontiac\xe2\x80\x99s innovative engineering had paid off with domination in the Super Stock classes, and when racers such as Mickey Thompson and Jim Wangers began stuffing the 421 Super Duty V8 into the compact Tempest platform, factory engineers ran with the concept, adding special components such as aluminum body panels, Hurst shifters and tubular headers. Based on the knowledge and experience that could only come from working closely with Pontiac\xe2\x80\x99s racing customers, these were true factory-built racecars. Only six such vehicles of each bodystyle were built before the General Motors racing ban, and this is the only wagon known to exist.

1963 Pontiac Tempest Coupe 421 Super Duty: 
Long known as the preferred brand of the senior set, Pontiac roared out of nowhere at the turn of the Sixties to claim multiple Super Stock championships. It kept the competition back on its heels with a flurry of new over-the-counter parts before finally introducing a radical new performance package that was more than the typical recipe of cubic inches, midsize body and deleted creature comforts.

1964 Pontiac LeMans GTO Convertible: 
The GTO was introduced in 1964 as a performance option for the Tempest in convertible, coupe and hardtop form. Standard equipment included 389 V8 which developed over 325 hp. Moreover, the package included a four-barrel carburetor, dual exhaust premium tires and a close ratio steering rack.

2004 Pontiac GTO Ram Air 6 Concept: 
Royal Oak , Mich. \x13 GM\x19s Performance Division unveiled the Pontiac GTO Ram Air 6 Employee Enthusiasm (EE!) concept vehicles at the 2004 Woodward Dream Cruise. Created for show purposes, the vehicle was completed by GM employee volunteers using parts donated by GM Powertrain, GM Performance Parts, and GM Design Center.

1969 Pontiac GTO Judge Convertible Ram Air IV: 
Above and beyond the GTO Judge package was the Ram Air IV. It was the most potent engine option available from Pontiac and was occasionally ordered with the Judge. Naturally, any convertible equipped as such is one of the most desirable and collectible Pontiacs around.
https://www.supercars.net/blog/1969-pontiac-gto-judge-convertible-ram-air-iv/

1969 Pontiac GTO Judge Convertible Ram Air III: 
In 1969 a range of engines was available with the GTO, but the Judge option came standard with the Ram Air III package. With 366 horsepower and 445 lb-ft of torque, it was more than enough to compete with the BOSS Mustangs and HEMI Mopars. As an upgraded option, owners could have the even more potent Ram Air IV engine which raised output to 370 horsepower and 445 ft lbs of torque.

1970 Pontiac GTO Judge: 
Along with the updated 1970 Tempest line came the new GTO Judge. The model year was distinguished by four fixed front headlights which were integrated into the Endura urethane cover. The basis for the Judge was a 455 in\xc2\xb3 V8 and could be ordered with a Ram Air III or Ram Air IV intake system.

1969 Pontiac GTO Convertible Ram Air IV: 
With what started as a performance package on the Tempest, the GTO became a staple of the muscle car era. With cars such as the Chevlle SS396, Plymouth Roadrunner and Ford Mustang 427 gaining sales, Pontiac responded with performance options which kept the GTO in the market until 1974.

2005 Pontiac GTO: 
With the 400-horsepower LS2 high performance small-block V-8 at the ready, the Pontiac GTO show vehicle comes with decidedly more power. Many individual components come together to form a unique package that sets this GTO apart. From nose to tail, specific components give this GTO a lower, more aggressive look. Custom-designed performance equipment from airbox to exhaust adds power to back the GTO\x19s visual punch.

IN 1967, Pontiac had to revise their top model GTO according to a GM mandate that limited engine size to 400 in\xc2\xb3 and a single carburetor on everything but their sports cars. In response, Pontiac raised the displacement on the the 389 and the High Output (HO) 400 was born.

1966 Pontiac GTO: 
In 1966 the GTO became a model in its own right and Pontiac equipped it with the 389 in\xc2\xb3 Tri-Power engine which produced 360 bhp. Nearly 97,000 GTOs were sold in 1966 and it became the best selling muscle car. This was largely impart due to the seductive styling of the 1966 model with it’s new coke bottle silhouette.

1963 Pontiac Catalina 421 Super Duty \xe2\x80\x98Swiss Cheese\xe2\x80\x99: 
As the 1962 drag season drew to a close, it was obvious that Pontiac\xe2\x80\x99s position at the top of the Super Stock hierarchy was weakening. Ford, Chrysler and Chevrolet were gaining on the Chiefs with bigger engines and an ever-increasing supply of special parts, including weight-saving aluminum components and body panels. Pontiac engineers knew they had to have a lighter, more powerful car for 1963, and it came in the form of a special Catalina bearing some serious modifications. First the chassis was altered by cutting the top section away from the boxed rails, leaving a U-shaped section. Then approximately 120 holes were drilled in the sides of the frame rails, removing as much material as possible while maintaining a semblance of structural integrity, resulting in the \xe2\x80\x9cSwiss Cheese\xe2\x80\x9d moniker that remains today.

1969\xe2\x86\x921969 Plymouth Road Runner 440 A12: 
Released in February 1969, Plymouth offered their potent 440 ‘Six Pack’ engine in the Road Runner with a package called A12. This included the potent 440 in\xc2\xb3 engine, Edelbrock manifolds, three Holley carburetors, a distinctive fiberglass hood and bare H-Series wheels. With these simple changes, the Roadrunner was much more than its Warner Brothers roots would suggest. Motor Trend named it “Car of the Year” in 1969.

1968 Shelby GT500KR Convertible: 
1968 was the first year Shelby American offered a Convertible version of their GT500 mustang. Half way through the year, the availability of the Cobra Jet engine transformed the model in the ‘Kinf of the Road’ Cobra GT500KR. Only 517 of these were produced before a major bodystyle change in 1969.
